## Chitter Backend

This is an API backend for a \*witter-like app. It has users, sessions posts,
and likes.

It is deployed at `https://chitter-backend-api-v2.herokuapp.com/`

## API docs

Each of these API endpoints are illustrated by a curl command that you can paste into your terminal to play around with.

If you ever need more information, pass the `-v` flag to curl in addition to the stated arguments. This will put it into verbose mode, and will show you the HTTP response code and other useful debugging information.

### Users

#### POST `/users`

Creates a new user.

```bash
curl "https://chitter-backend-api-v2.herokuapp.com/users" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user": {"handle":"kay", "password":"mypassword"}}'
```

On success, the above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id" : 1,
  "handle" : "kay"
}
```

### Sessions

#### POST `/sessions`

Creates a new session, giving you a `user_id` and `session_key` required to perform actions on behalf of the user (e.g. posting peeps, liking peeps).

Creating a new session renders any previous `session_key`s invalid.

```bash
curl "https://chitter-backend-api-v2.herokuapp.com/sessions" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session": {"handle":"kay", "password":"mypassword"}}'
```

On success, the above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "session_key": "a_valid_session_key"
}
```

#### GET `/peeps`

Returns a list of the last 50 peeps in reverse chronological order.
